A minimalist SPARQL library for dart.

## Motivation

I have several use cases for this library, but to give an example, I would like to be able to search for
Wikipedia pages on certain topics from a Flutter app using an audio only interface.

I am by no way an Flutter, Dart or Wikidata (or SPARQL) expert, so I see this as a beginner project to get
into all of these projects and topics.

This should be able to serve as an inspiration, what can be done, and I will use it in my own projects,
but don't expect this to be a well maintained library. Feel free to use the source in your own projects!

## Usage

is still missing...
